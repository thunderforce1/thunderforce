        <h2 style="font-family: Courier New">Appearance</h2>
        
        <p style="font-family: Courier New">Tsukasa Naruhito is seen as a slim muscular man with a bit of a tall height. He has pale bluish grayish eyes with light blonde hair. Up close to his face he has a mole near his right eye and an earring hanging down from his right earlobe. He's seen usually wearing some loose clothing, a light green overcoat with a light blue plain shirt.He's seen wearing long pants but would occasionally wear shorts as well that would be accompanied with slippers.</p>
        
        <h2 style="font-family: Courier New">Personality</h2>
        
        <p style="font-family: Courier New">Tsukasa has a light hearted demeanor, he kind of comes off as rude, brash, or harsh in somewhat of a childish way.He can be arrogant at times and will typically only think of himself. Through that though, he has a moral compass and would usually help others if he thinks it's right. He cares deeply about his comrades and is quite reliable when doing tasks for another. He has a strong sense of empathy to help others but quite ruthless and aggressive to Blights or any kind of evil presented to him. He's quite clever in battle and will use the environment as his weapon to take down his enemies. He's a quick learner as well, being quick to learn how to properly manipulate his Core Energy during his training.</p>
        
        <h2 style="font-family: Courier New">Background</h2>
        
        <p style="font-family: Courier New">Tsukasa enjoyed a childhood that could be considered quite satisfactory. His parents exhibited commendable qualities and provided him with a nurturing upbringing. He harbored a rather peculiar fascination with the notion of kingship, relishing the exhilarating prospect of reigning supreme. Until he ventured into adulthood, he seemed to traverse life without any notable adversities. At the tender age of 23, he found himself meandering through the vibrant streets of Osaka, indulging in street food from the bustling street vendors and reveling in a spirited evening at the Osaka Castle. </p>
        
        <p style="font-family: Courier New">However, his fortunes took a dark turn during his visit to the venerable Hokoku Shrine, where a malevolent Blight lurked, ensnaring unsuspecting souls under the cover of night. Regrettably, Tsukasa fell prey to this sinister force. On the precipice of death, he managed to flee the shrine; though his body was beleaguered, compassionate bystanders swiftly transported him to the hospital upon witnessing his motionless form. Upon his full recuperation, however, the dread of his harrowing ordeal ignited within him a resolute determination to confront the Blights personally. Subsequently apprised of the tragic demise of others, Tsukasa resolved to eradicate these fiends and alleviate the ensuing anguish, or, at the very least, temper it significantly. Joining the Blight Extermination Front, he pursued a singular aim... </p>
        
        <p style="font-family: Courier New">‚ÄùThose who stray from the righteous path shall be shown the light..."</p>

        <h2 style="font-family: Courier New">Abilities / Powers</h2>
        
        <p style="font-family: Courier New">Superhuman Strength/Speed/Durability: Tsukasa possesses strength beyond that of an average human, being able to punch through solid metal as well as being able to catch 4 cars at once crashing into him. His speed is almost like a blur, seemingly teleporting from a short distance. BUT, he isn't as fast as lightning. He also possesses extreme durability, able to tank attacks from fighters above his level.
        Tsukasa also displays profiecency upon hand to hand combat, able to fend off many Blights at once with skill alone. His fighting style is something between Taekwondo, Karate, Muay Thai, and even Krav Maga.
        Weapons: Tsukasa's weapon is the environment itself. He chooses not to have his own weapon but use his surroundings as weapons instead. Using a Stop Sign as a shield, a sword, or even a staff. If there were no objects however, he'd resort to using his bare hands for battle instead, he's a natural brawler.</p>

The guitar and amplifier collaborate seamlessly, transmuting the electrical signals elicited by the guitar's pickups into resonant sound via the amplifier, where the signal is both enhanced and refined to cultivate the preferred tone. In this context, Tsukasa or his partner exchanges their Core Energy, necessitating the partner's steadfast alignment with the other's 'frequency' of the Core Energy to avoid Core Bond Disruption. As this exchange recurs, each pulse of Core Energy inexplicably amplifies energy and power, with each contribution magnified by the synergy of the two participants. Habitually, this engenders connections among the individuals, manifesting as a glowing orb suspended between them, symbolizing an artificial Core forged from Core Energy. With this established, individuals entwined in this technique can deliver heightened force to their offensive and defensive techniques. Nevertheless, a drawback exists: this technique ought only to be employed for the swift incapacitation of opponents, as it exacts a considerable toll on each participant. Furthermore, the energy may swiftly wane if the cycle is not perpetually sustained; typically, this technique is reserved for decisive conclusions. </span><br><br><span style="font-weight:700;font-style:italic;text-decoration:none">Merging Technique (Added with Construction AND OR Summoning class). </span><br><span style="font-weight:700;font-style:italic;text-decoration:none"> </span><br><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none"> This sub-technique may be executed either through a user‚Äôs Summoning Class technique or through any entity possessing a CORE. Nonetheless, employing one‚Äôs Summoning Class technique shall prove considerably less arduous, as the creation's Core, Core Bonds, and Core Energy would harmoniously align with their creator. With the initiation of the Resonation technique, as the participants repeat the amplifying cycle, the artificial Core interposed between them shall gain sufficient stability to sustain a physical body, as the two become utterly attuned to one another. Thereafter, the individuals shall use Manipulation Class upon their bodies, seamlessly amalgamating their forms within the fortified artificial Core. The Cores of the participants are encapsulated within this artificial Core, which possesses the capacity to accommodate an unlimited array of Cores. The merged entity‚Äôs Core Bonds will exhibit a confluence of all participants' Core Bonds, thus enabling the execution and modulation of amalgamated assaults. This fusion further grants access to the participants' diverse forms, harmonizing them with one another. As the artificial Core represents an intricate synthesis of intensified waves of Core Energy exchanged repeatedly, the power of the fusion is exponentially augmented a hundred-fold.
